       <h3 class="heading"> About Muniba Mazari</h3>
        <p>Muniba Mazari (The Iron Lady of Pakistan) is an activist, anchor, artist, model, singer, and motivational speaker. Despite sitting in a wheelchair for almost 14 years due to a car crash, she has made it to the top. She was designated the UN Women Pakistan’s National Ambassador after being added to the BBC’s list of the 100 Most Inspiring Women of 2015. She was also added to Forbes’ 2016 list of the ‘30 Under 30’.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Muniba Mazari: Education and Marriage</h3>
        <p>Born in Rahim Yar Khan (Southern Punjab) on March 3 1987, Muniba belongs to a tribe called Mazari. She went to study at the Army Public School and pursued her BFA from a college in her native hometown.
        She married an obscure Pakistani man at the age of 18 for the sake of her father’s happiness. After two years of living in a failed marriage, on February 27, 2008, she was traveling from Quetta to Rahim Yar Khan with her husband, and they got involved in a severe and unfortunate accident.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Muniba Mazari Challenges</h3>
           <p> Muniba claims that being in a wheelchair was the happiest day of her life. She decided to confront and conquer all of her fears. “That day, I looked in the mirror, applying a lip color, and told myself, ‘I’ll never give up.’” I’ll never live up to anyone’s expectations.” She said. That day, she planned to write down all of her fears and face them one by one.
            <br><br>
           1. Husband Fear
            Her biggest fear was being divorced by her husband, and the next thing she did was set him free.
            <br><br>
           2. Motherhood
            Her second biggest fear was not able to give birth and be a mother, so she applied to different organizations and orphanages. After two years, in 2011, she got a call from an agency, and she adopted her son the Nile who is 10 years old now.
            <br><br>
           3. Sympathy Syndrome
            Her third largest fear was facing people and the look of sympathy in their eyes. But she overcame that fear too by going out in public and not minding their sympathy. She had always hated being accepted as a differently-abled citizen in the world. Because since she embraced herself before everyone else, she no longer cares what others think of her.

           </p>

           <h3 class="heading">Overcoming Challenges</h3>
           <p> She began to go out in public and tell people her story and how everyone should be accepted equally. She started to paint, and anchor shows in Pakistan. She also advocates for women’s and children’s rights, for which she has received worldwide recognition.
            
            Three people, she says, have influenced her and completely changed her life, Waleed Khan (a terrorist attack survivor), Nile (Muniba’s son), and Muniba’s mother. We don’t have to be flawless with anything we do, she says, and we should embrace ourselves as we are, no matter if the rest of the world views us.</p>
